     name: "Let Honey-Butter Sit"
     step: "Let the honey butter sit in a warm area of the kitchen, or over the lowest possible fl ame on the stove, until you’re ready to use it. It’s important to keep it warm so it will spread easily—and the longer you let it sit, the better the honey butter will be."

Slap the dough down hard with the palms of your hands to really bring it together, and then roll it out and fold it in again. Do this 7 times in all, skipping the folding step the seventh time. Reflour the work surface, the dough, and the rolling pin as you go."
